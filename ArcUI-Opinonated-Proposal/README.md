# Arc UI (Opinonated UI Proposal)

Arc inspired UI for the Zen Browser with opinonated changes.

## Description

The theme is inspired by the Arc UI with opinionated changes:

- The web panel and the extensions panel (bookmarks, history, etc..) is always
  in floating state. This ensures that the bookmarks are next to the tabs and
  can then be exchanged by drag-and-drop.
- The urlbar is visually integrated into the web page.
- The elements from the urlbar are only visible on-hover.
- Tabs are colored in the container colors when they are selected. I use
  containers heavily with Temporary Containers for every page and some
  persistent containers I log-in often (eg. google), I want to keep seperated
  from my usual browsing (eg. facebook), and for oauth logins I use on several
  pages (eg. discord). So, I want the container information, color coded, but
  don't want to be overwhelmed by it and reminded constantly.

The project is work-in-progress, and something that I use on a daily basis. Bugs
will be fixed as I encounter them.

Planned next:

- Floating searchbar
- Floating statusbar
- Redesign of the urlbar when focused and search suggestions are expanded
- Giving pins more space
- Background gradients like in Arc

The goal is a UI that I like to use and, possibly, that encourages the
developers of Zen to redesign the current UI, to be more zenfull and less
cluttered.

Inspired by a couple of Themes that I installed and configured on every Zen
Browser Installation. Very Thanks to:
